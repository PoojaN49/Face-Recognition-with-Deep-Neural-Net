# Face-Recognition-with-Deep-Neural-Net
Classifying a Face as Happy/Unhappy and Face Recognition using LeNet 5,AlexNet , VGG16

Given:
600 RGB (labeled) training images each of size 64Ã—64, with labels 0 (not happy) and 1 (happy).
150 (unlabeled) test images (also the ground-truths separately).
Train a deep convolution neural net model for binary classification.
Use the model to predict the labels of the test images and evaluate the model using the ground truth.
